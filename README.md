It is nice if you are reading this. I am going to try explain my logic while making this project. 
I am making minesweeper, I am not sure how difficult it is, but with enough time if I spend like a week I would probably understand (making and understanding is different things aint they).

I actually saw this on one site, which amazed me (simple thing but functional) I think I never thought of assigning different values like this. I don’t like to do big words most of the time because I forget how to write them.

After this snippet (?) on the site, of course there was some other stuff. Even if I read, it is like words became worms. Practice is good but it feels like banging on the wall and there is nothing behind it.

I think it is unprofessional that I say and act the way I do, but I am not even a programmer so I think I can get some slack for the 1st year. I probably wont say anything from now on, cause this is not my struggle notebook. 
I did forget to make mine into mines, erm, yeah…

Surprisingly nothing has gone wrong. Maybe I would be able to finish soon (I _ I)

I spoke too soon
Why
Just why
What did I do
Will I spend another decade to fix VS code?

I also have to install it on my other pc so the misery is ever lasting. 
Don’t wish me luck I do not believe that it will help with this demon of the program.
